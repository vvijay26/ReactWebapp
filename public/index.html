      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

  Some Theory for understading - 

  React Components - re-usable and independent pieces of React code that comprise the User Interface.

ES6 importing and exporting - a new syntax for sharing code between separate files. Used in cases like `import React from ‘react’`

State - the pertinent data to an application. Each component has its local state as long as you declare add the constructor to a Component and declare its state object.

Updating State - When updating state, make sure to never mutate state directly. Doing so will lead to fatal errors in your application. Instead, re-declare new instances of state arrays or objects and use the setState() function to update state.

Props - similar to state, except this data inherits from parent component specifying pieces of state as properties.

LifeCycle Methods - events in React components that trigger in cases such as rendering on or off the screen, or during state updates. One example is the `componentDidMount()` lifeCycle hook.
